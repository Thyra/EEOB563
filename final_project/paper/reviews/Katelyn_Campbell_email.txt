I've attached your paper with my comments and suggestions.

First things first: I converted your paper from a pdf to a word document and your original format got kind of funky. I did my best to get it back to the original format but I might have missed things or put them in the wrong spot. Basically if there's something different, but doesn't have a comment or tracked change, than it was most likely unintentional. 

I understand that you are still actively working on this research and you said don't worry too much about formatting and wording. You have a solid and very interesting project! That being said I did provide a lot of feedback regarding formatting/ wording because I was being nit picky and wanted to provide you with as much feedback as possible. 

Here are my overall comments about your paper:
- I'm a little confused on what the focus of your paper is. Is the focus on modifying the analysis style by using gene ontology or the plants you used? If your focus is more on the plants then you should discuss them more in your intro.
- I really like that you provided examples! It helped reinforce your point. Just make sure you explain them fully. 
- Pay attention to the style and length of your sentences. You had some run on sentences and some of the sentence format itself often was confusing.
- Phylogenetics isn't my forte so there is a good chance I commented on jargon that people within the field all know. Haha so if that is the case just ignore my comment. 

Your paper is really interesting and good! I hope my feedback is helpful! If you have any questions or need clarification on any of my comments please let me know! I look forward to seeing your presentation!
