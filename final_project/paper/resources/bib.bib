abstract = {Abstract We created a new high-coverage, robust, and reproducible functional annotation of maize protein-coding genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments. Whereas the existing Phytozome and Gramene maize GO annotation sets only cover 41\% and 56\% of maize protein-coding genes, respectively, this study provides annotations for 100\% of the genes. We also compared the quality of our newly derived annotations with the existing Gramene and Phytozome functional annotation sets by comparing all three to a manually annotated gold standard set of 1,619 genes where annotations were primarily inferred from direct assay or mutant phenotype. Evaluations based on the gold standard indicate that our new annotation set is measurably more accurate than those from Phytozome and Gramene. To derive this new high-coverage, high-confidence annotation set, we used sequence similarity and protein domain presence methods as well as mixed-method pipelines that were developed for the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Our project to improve maize annotations is called maize-GAMER (GO Annotation Method, Evaluation, and Review), and the newly derived annotations are accessible via MaizeGDB (http://download.maizegdb.org/maize-GAMER) and CyVerse (B73 RefGen\_v3 5b+ at doi.org/10.7946/P2S62P and B73 RefGen\_v4 Zm00001d.2 at doi.org/10.7946/P2M925).}

abstract="In response to the rapid growth of available genome sequences, efforts have been made to develop automatic inference methods to functionally characterize them. Pipelines that infer functional annotation are now routinely used to produce new annotations at a genome scale and for a broad variety of species. These pipelines differ widely in their inference algorithms, confidence thresholds and data sources for reasoning. This heterogeneity makes a comparison of the relative merits of each approach extremely complex. The evaluation of the quality of the resultant annotations is also challenging given there is often no existing gold-standard against which to evaluate precision and recall.",
